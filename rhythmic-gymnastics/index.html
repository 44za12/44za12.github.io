                <p>The performance of systematic physical exercise with the use of hand equipment such as ropes, hoops, balls, clubs, and ribbons is known as rythmic gymnastics. It is closely related to women's artistic gymnastics, which is a sport involving the vaulting horse, uneven parallel bars, balance beam, and floor, and is linked to dance, as is synchronised swimming. The sport stretches back to the 18th century, and while some gymnasts competed in individual and group exercises at the Olympic Games from 1948 to 1956, individual competition did not become an official competitive event until the 1984 Olympics. Gymnasts must be strong, flexible, nimble, dexterous, and coordinated; the sport includes aspects of gymnastics, dance, and callisthenics. An individual routine lasts 1–11/2 minutes and is performed by one gymnast with one piece of apparatus, whereas a group performance lasts 21/2–3 minutes and is performed by six gymnasts with six pieces of apparatus. A single musical instrument, generally a piano, is used to accompany both. </p>
